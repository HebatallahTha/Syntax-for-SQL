**By Hebatallah Tharhan**  
*Assignment 1 â€” CIS111 (Murach College Database)*

### ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains my very first set of SQL practice queries for **CIS111** using the **Murach College** database.  
It focuses on **selecting data, filtering results, and basic query structure** â€” the foundations of SQL.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced
- Using `SELECT` to retrieve data  
- Choosing specific columns instead of `*`  
- Sorting with `ORDER BY` (`ASC` and `DESC`)  
- Filtering rows with `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`  
- Concatenating strings with `+`  
- Using functions like:
  - `GETDATE()` â†’ current date
  - `DATEDIFF()` â†’ time difference in months
  - `YEAR()` â†’ extracting the year
- Applying `TOP` and percentages to limit results
